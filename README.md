# grepcidr in python

This is a simple python script that filters files like access_logs by cidr
networks like 192.168.1.0/24 which would be relatively simple with GNU grep but
also cidr networks like 172.16.0.0/20 or any other prefix.

Let me know if you find this tool cool or if you have any questions or
requirements within the issues or pull requests. :)

Happy grepping!
